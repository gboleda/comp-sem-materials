- Data used in the tutorial / cheatsheet, in case you want to practice: 

	practice-dataframe.csv - simple toy dataset. Entirely made-up. 

	survey-life-satisfaction.csv - survey data gathered within a course taught by G. Boleda. Each row contains data about one person; the columns are self-explanatory, I hope.
